# Optimisation-Method

The standard __form__ of a continuous optimization __problem__ is:

There is __no single method__ available for solving all optimization problems efficiently. 

One can use a number of different methods depending on the specific problem. 

- __Mathematical programming methods.__ These are useful in finding the minimum of a function of several variables under a prescribed set of constraints.
- __Stochastic process techniques.__ These are used to analyze problems which are described by a set of random variables of known distribution.
- __Statistical methods.__These are used in the analysis of experimental data and in the construction of empirical models.
